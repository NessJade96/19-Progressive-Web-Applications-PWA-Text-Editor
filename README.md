# 19-Progressive-Web-Applications-PWA-Text-Editor

## Description:

a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria.
Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.
The application will also function offline.

## User Setup: // need to udpate!

To use this at home, in your terminal run the following commands to invoke the application:
`npm i` to install packages,
then `npm run start` starts the live server.
